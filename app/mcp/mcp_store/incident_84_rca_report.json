    "timestamp": "2025-06-23T18:20:00",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the incident is a timeout issue with the scraping of metrics from the node-exporter service, likely due to a high load or slow response time from the service.",
    "recommendation": "To fix this issue, consider increasing the timeout value for the scraping operation or optimizing the node-exporter service to improve its response time. Additionally, implementing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff can help to mitigate the impact of temporary service unavailability."
