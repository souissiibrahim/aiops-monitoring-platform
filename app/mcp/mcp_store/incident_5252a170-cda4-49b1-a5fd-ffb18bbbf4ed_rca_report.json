    "recommendation": "- Check and optimize the storage backend configuration on node-auth-prod-01 to reduce disk IO latency. (confidence: 0.9)\n- Monitor and analyze the disk usage and performance on /dev/sda1 to identify potential bottlenecks and consider upgrading or replacing the disk if necessary. (confidence: 0.8)\n- Implement disk caching or buffering mechanisms to reduce the impact of disk IO latency on the auth-service. (confidence: 0.7)",
