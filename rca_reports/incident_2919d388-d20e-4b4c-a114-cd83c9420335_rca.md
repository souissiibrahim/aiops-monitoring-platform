### 📋 Logs
- ERROR: Latency spike detected on `/send-notification` endpoint
- WARNING: Redis cache miss rate exceeded 80%
- INFO: Upstream service `user-profile-service` response delayed by 2.9s

---

### 🧠 Root Cause
**The root cause of the incident is a timeout issue with the scraping of metrics from the node-exporter service, likely due to a high load or slow response time from the service.**

---

### ✅ Recommendation
**- To fix this issue, consider increasing the timeout value for the scraping operation or optimizing the node-exporter service to improve its response time. Additionally, implementing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff can help to mitigate the impact of temporary service unavailability. (confidence: 1.0)**
