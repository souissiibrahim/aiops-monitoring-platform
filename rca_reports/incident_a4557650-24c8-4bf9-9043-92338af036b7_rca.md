### 📋 Logs
- Disk usage at 92% on /var; deleting temporary files.
- Rotating and clearing old log files in /var/log.
- Vacuuming systemd journal to free space.
- CPU usage spiked above 90% on node
- Thread pool saturation detected; request latency increasing
- Single process consuming excessive CPU across cores; system slowdown observed
- Top CPU offender persists for >60s window; mitigation required
- Suggested remediation: kill high CPU process to restore performance

### 🧠 Root Cause
**Single process consuming excessive CPU across cores; system slowdown observed**

---

### ✅ Recommendations
- Monitor and investigate the top CPU offender process to identify and address the root cause of high CPU usage. (confidence: 0.9)
- Implement a process monitoring and killing mechanism to automatically terminate high CPU processes and prevent system slowdown. (confidence: 0.8)
- Consider upgrading the node's CPU or adding more nodes to the cluster to improve overall system performance and reduce the likelihood of CPU saturation. (confidence: 0.6)
