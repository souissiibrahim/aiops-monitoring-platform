### ✅ Recommendation
**- Recommendation is to free up disk space on /dev/sda1 by deleting unnecessary files, moving files to a different disk, or expanding the disk size. Additionally, consider implementing a disk space monitoring and alerting system to prevent similar issues in the future. (confidence: 1.0)**
